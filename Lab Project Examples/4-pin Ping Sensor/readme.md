As with all things we should start by looking at the data sheet below is the data sheet for the HC - SR04

The data sheet informs us that one pin is used to activate the sensor (Trig) and the other (Echo) is used to messure the distance.

The ping sensor Di Jasio uses is a 3 pin type meaning the Trig and Echo are done via one pin.
