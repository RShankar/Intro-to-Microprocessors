The EMC1001 is hard wired to RC3 and RC4 for its I2C comunication. So we have to use 2 other pins for our seven segment display. RC3 is what we where useing for controling our B_SEG and RC4 controls the cathod hooked up to digit 3.

For this work around we reroute B_SEG from RC3 to RA1 and our C3 from RC4 to RA0. To achive this we first bend the 2 pins in question so they are out some. Becarful this should bend with no problem but you do not want to snap the pin or break the solder joint.
