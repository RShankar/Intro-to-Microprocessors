The main difference for us is that we are useing a single NeoPixel where as Di Jasio uses a home made board with more than one NeoPixel. 

For this we will edit to code to alternate multiple colors on a single LED instead of pushing mutiple colors to different LEDs.

To start with Di Jasio uses RC3 for SDO1 we will be useing RB5 as it lines up nicly with 3.3v and GND that we need.

Note: you must supply the NeoPixel with 3.3v if you are communicating to it with 3.3v it will not hear the 3.3v communication if you are supplying 5v.
