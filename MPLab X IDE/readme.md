__Install MPLAB X IDE first__
You can use all the default setting. 
There is a setting to collect information for the betterment of the program.
Some people do not like to provide any information to the companies.
If you don't wish to provide information back to the manufacture slimly uncheck the required box

After the installer has finished the program it will pop up asking to install drivers

__IMPORTANT:__ if you get an error during the driver installation please follow this link http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/50002027D.pdf to the MPLABX IDE User Guide
On page 32 is the process to installed the drivers manually. You can also attempt to uninstall MPLABX and reinstall.

Next you will see this window if you have not already downloaded the compiler this will direct you to the websites to do so.
Write about unchecking stuff

__Now install the compiler__ as mentioned earlier we are using the 8-Bit compiler for our 8-bit microcontroller
You can use all the default setting for this instalation as well. 
The free version has no restrictions that will affect your work

Now that both are installed there is one last program to install it is the __MCC__ which is a plugin in MPLab X 
Open your MPLAB X IDE
Go to Tools->Plugins

Find the MPLAB Code Configurator in the list then install
