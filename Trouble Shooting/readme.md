Once in the Device Manager under "Other Devices" you should find "Microchip Composite Device".

**Note** If you do not see this then either your evaluation board is not connected to your PC or this is not the problem you are having

From here right click on "Microchip Composite Device" and choose "Update Driver Software..."
