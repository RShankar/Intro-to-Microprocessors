# Intro-to-Microprocessors
Documentation of material covered in the spring '19 class lectures on this topic

This is a core course that we teach at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) for engineering undergraduates. We use both C and Assembly language in developing codes for use on a TI board. We use TI's CCStudio software, available both on the cloud and for use on individual laptops. The board is connected through an USB port of the dumb terminal in our computer labs (to access the cloud version) or the laptop. 

Syllabus and Lab manual, both prepared by Dr. Bassem Alhalabhi, are enclosed. He is the lead faculty member who has taught this course for a number of years at FAU.
