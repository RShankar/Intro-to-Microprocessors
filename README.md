# Intro-to-Microprocessors
Documentation of material covered in the spring '19 class lectures on this topic

This is a core course that we teach at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) for engineering undergraduates. We use both C and Assembly language in developing codes for use on a TI board. We use TI's CCStudio software, available both on the cloud and for use on individual laptops. The board is connected through an USB port of the dumb terminal in our computer labs (to access the cloud version) or the laptop. 

This Repository is focused on PIC16 and its C compiler, in an attempt to develop a distance learning friendly environment for teaching this course. PIC16 (our specific version is: PIC16F18855), marketed around 2015, is also a RISC (reduced instruction set computer) architecture that is C-friendly. The technical reference manual from the [microchip website](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/400001802D.pdf) is attached.  They also provide several [examples](https://mplabxpress.microchip.com/mplabcloud/example). There are 133 examples included for this specific microcontroller, as of Nov 2018. MPLab Express Evaluation Boards are listed [here](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/30010119B.pdf). The specific one for our purposes is: MPLAB Xpress PIC16F18877 Evaluation Board (DM164142). The board that we have has the product number of DM164140. DigiKey provides a [datasheet](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/DM164140/DM164140-ND/6044842?WT.srch=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItPHnhKD63gIVA1uGCh3HnwjgEAQYASABEgJeNfD_BwE). 

From a Microchip [site](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/30010119B.pdf): "MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) is a free software plugin – available in both the MPLAB X IDE and MPLAB Xpress IDE – that bridges our MCUs, development hardware, and your code. With MCC, you can easily generate modifiable, production-ready application code for the MPLAB Xpress Evaluation Boards in just a few mouse clicks. Find out more at www.microchip.com/MCC ". It is my understanding that there is a cloud-based compiler that can also be used directly with the board (via an usb link to a local PC). 

The electrosome.com website has multiple [tutorials](https://electrosome.com/category/tutorials/pic-microcontroller/mplab-xc8/) that seem amenable for easy interconnections. Their first tutorial is also included, with appropriate acknowledgement here.
