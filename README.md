# Intro-to-Microprocessors
Documentation of material covered in the spring '19 class lectures on this topic

This is a core course that we teach at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) for engineering undergraduates. We use both C and Assembly language in developing codes for use on a TI board. We use TI's CCStudio software, available both on the cloud and for use on individual laptops. The board is connected through an USB port of the dumb terminal in our computer labs (to access the cloud version) or the laptop. 

This Repository is focused on PIC16 and its C compiler, in an attempt to develop a distance learning friendly environment for teaching this course. PIC16 is also a RISC (reduced instruction set computer) architecture that is C-friendly. The technical reference manual from the [microchip website](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/400001802D.pdf) is attached. The electrosome.com website has multiple [tutorials](https://electrosome.com/category/tutorials/pic-microcontroller/mplab-xc8/) that seem amenable for easy interconnections. Their first tutorial is also included, with appropriate acknowledgement here.
