Start from the examples site given [here](https://mplabxpress.microchip.com/mplabcloud/example). Choose the device as PIC16F18855. Choose the first example ("Hello World.").  Click on the Title on the left hand side. Scroll down and find an external link for 'Step by Step instructions.' You will be given the board next week. For now, skip the fist step ('task 1') on connecting your evaluation board to the PC via an USB connector. You cannot do task 9 now either (about drag and drop of the Hex code. You should be able to do remainder of the steps. 

We have verified that the Cloud IDE and MCC work on Windows 7 and 10. We expect it will work on Linux (see notes below). For Mac, you may need VMware or VirtualBox. 

Installation of MCC may give some problems - it requires javaws to launch. The default program attached to it by Windows may be wordpad or Java Launcher. First make sure you have the latest version of Java. Go to Control Panel\Programs\Programs and Features and ensure you have Java 8 update 191. If not, download from [here] (https://www.java.com/en/download/).  

Steps to associate the jnlp with Javaws application are given [here](https://blackboard.secure.force.com/btbb_exportarticlepdf?id=kA770000000CbF5CAK). 

If the above Blackboard steps do not make sense, read this: Javaws - Java web start launcher, is different from the usual Java web launcher. You have to open the properties of the saved .jnlp file, hit the 'Change' button associated with the 'Opens with' icon, hit 'Browse', browse to the Java folder and drill down to the javaws (in my case it was in Java/jre 1.8.0_191/bin folder). right click on it, choose open. It will show up in the original 'other Programs' as 'Java(TM) Web Start Luancher' with an additional line about the company (Oracle Corporation). Hit OK. Apply and OK in the properties window of the jnlp file. When you open the MCC again, make sure you choose Java web start launcher, not the Java web launcher. MCC should launch with the GUI to adjust different periperhals, registers, etc. 

Linux installation:  I used command line to download and install icedtea-netx and then executed javaws on the .jnlp file. Error message: Not a launchable jnlp file. However, as with Win 7, I could run previously developed code successfully on the board plugged in. Directions at this [link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/565016/how-to-run-a-jnlp-file-in-ubuntu-server). Actually, for a different application, I had to link earlier with IBM Java version and this [link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/293117/not-able-to-install-javaws) implies that I would need Oracle Java. I am unable to try this out, because of my other application; but if you are using Linux, please try it out. I expect it will work.
